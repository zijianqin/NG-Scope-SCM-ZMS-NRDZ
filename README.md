NG-Scope
========

NG-Scope is a versatile system designed to support the efficient decoding of control channels from multiple base stations. From a block-level processing perspective, data flows through  NG-Scope as follows:
 
1. 	Signal Reception and Synchronization:
NG-Scope receives wireless signals from a cell and performs cell synchronization using the PSS and SSS signals transmitted by the corresponding base station. This process ensures accurate timing alignment with the cell's subframes.
 
2. 	Subframe Segmentation:
Upon successful synchronization, NG-Scope identifies the boundaries of each subframe and divides the received IQ data into segments of 1ms, representing individual subframes. All IQ segments are then stored inside a dedicated subframe buffer.
 
3. 	Parallel DCI Decoding:
NG-Scope optimizes its performance by implementing a thread pool for DCI decoding. Multiple decoder instances are spawned to efficiently decode the control channel of each cell simultaneously. By doing so, the system avoids excessive subframe buffering and ensures real-time processing.
 
4. 	DCI Message Storage:
The decoded DCI messages are temporarily stored inside a DCI buffer. As the decoding occurs in parallel, the sequence of decoded DCIs may not be in chronological order initially.
 
5. 	Status Tracker:
To handle the out-of-order decoded DCIs, NG-Scope implements a Status Tracker. This component fetches the decoded DCIs from the buffer, orders them sequentially, and stores them in a ring buffer. Each cell has a separate ring buffer to maintain its decoded DCI messages.
 
6. 	DCI Logging:
With the DCIs now properly ordered by the Status Tracker, NG-Scope implements a DCI logger to log the decoded DCIs. The logged DCIs are presented in the correct order, providing a clear and accurate representation of the control channel data.
 
7. 	GUI Visualization:
NG-Scope goes a step further by implementing a user-friendly GUI that allows users to visualize the decoded DCI messages. This intuitive interface enhances the overall user experience and facilitates data interpretation.
 
8. 	DCI Streaming via Network:
To enable remote access and sharing of decoded DCIs, NG-Scope includes a DCI Sink. This component streams the decoded DCIs to remote locations via the network, allowing seamless data transfer and analysis.
 
9. 	Real-Time Processing Library:
NG-Scope incorporates a powerful real-time processing library that operates on the DCIs stored inside the ring buffer. Standard functions, such as calculating the cell's bandwidth usage and the capacity of individual mobile devices, are provided. Additionally, the library is designed to be easily extensible for the implementation of further functionalities.
 
In conclusion, NG-Scope offers a comprehensive and efficient workflow for decoding control channels from multiple base stations. Its parallel processing capabilities, intelligent data ordering, and user-friendly features make it an invaluable tool for analyzing and interpreting cellular communication data in real-time.

NG-Scope 2.0 now supports the decoding of both FDD and TDD base stations, covering all types of LTE base stations. More specifically, we have tested and verified the TDD decoding functionality on CBRS cells that operates at 3.5GHz.

The first step towards decoding 5G Base Station: NG-Scope 2.0 represents a significant milestone in our journey towards decoding 5G base stations. Through extensive testing and verification, we have ensured the capability of NG-Scope 2.0 to successfully decode 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) base stations. Our findings indicate that a majority of 5G NSA deployments in the US continue to utilize the LTE RAN infrastructure while implementing a 5G core network. NG-Scope 2.0 empowers users to gain insights into this evolving landscape of hybrid LTE and 5G deployments, enabling comprehensive analysis and monitoring of 5G NSA base stations.

Improved Parallelism: Building upon the foundation of NG-Scope 2.0, the parallel decoding platform has undergone significant improvements. We have optimized the platform by splitting functions into separate threads, such as the task scheduler thread, DCI decoder thread, status tracking thread, buffer handling thread, and DCI-Logging thread. These enhancements result in improved robustness, increased speed, and enhanced coding efficiency. The revamped parallel decoding platform also enables seamless scaling of the number of supported base stations, providing flexibility to accommodate various deployment scenarios.

Efficient Logging System: NG-Scope 2.0 introduced an efficient logging system that seamlessly integrates into the parallel decoding platform. This logging system records the decoded control messages, facilitating detailed analysis and troubleshooting. By capturing and organizing valuable information, the logging system enhances the overall analysis process and aids in identifying and resolving potential issues.
